//Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?//

I basically had a very hard time catching up with my assignements because I fell way behind. I understand the concept of c++ through my course reading and assigments. I did have alot of trouble running the integrating program projects because I couldnt get the code to output the menu.
I would highly recommend people not to fall behind because it will definitely screw you over. I have tried my best through out the course, and I just fell behind because I didnt have much time on my hands.
